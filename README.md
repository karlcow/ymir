# Script to manage La Grange version 2012

This script will take a very simple html file and will make it ready to be published to La Grange. The raw article contains only the blog post and no stylesheets, Web site titles, etc. The script process the raw file and prepare it for publishing adding the relevant link. 

The script must be able to reprocess an already published file. I should not be dependent on keeping the raw version of each blog post. Once published I can work with the published version. 

See the [list of issues](https://github.com/karlcow/ymir/issues) for things which need to be implemented.
