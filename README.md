# Script to manage La Grange version 2012

This script will take a very simple html file and will make it ready to be published to La Grange. The raw article contains only the blog post and no stylesheets, Web site titles, etc. The script process the raw file and prepare it for publishing adding the relevant link. 

The script must be able to reprocess an already published file. I should not be dependent on keeping the raw version of each blog post. Once published I can work with the published version. 

See the [list of issues](https://github.com/karlcow/ymir/issues) for things which need to be implemented.

## Name origin for the script

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ymir) 

>In Norse mythology, Ymir, Aurgelmir, Brimir, or Bláinn is a primeval being born of primordial elemental poison and the ancestor of all jötnar. Ymir is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier tradition material, in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in the poetry of skalds. Taken together, several stanzas from four poems collected in in the Poetic Edda refer to Ymir as a primeval being who was born from venom that dripped from the icy rivers Élivágar and lived in the grassless void of Ginnungagap. Ymir birthed a male and female from the pits of his arms, and his legs together begat a six-headed being. The gods (unspecified) fashioned the Earth (elsewhere personified as a goddess; Jörð) from his flesh, from his blood the ocean, from his bones the hills, from his hair the trees, from his brains the clouds, from his skull the heavens, and from his eyebrows the middle realm in which mankind lives, Midgard. In addition, one stanza relates that the dwarfs were given life by the gods from Ymir's flesh and blood (or the Earth and sea).
